                Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark[9] was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and
                the
                former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius,
                billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge,
                Stark
                was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy
                lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a
                fleet
                of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape
                his
                captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as
                Obadiah
                Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as
                Iron
                Man.
            </p>
            <p>Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor
                poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his legacy. After
                the
                Stark Expo incident, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used
                his
                position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with Pepper Potts. With the world yet
                again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to the
                battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to
                safeguard
                the world and help him retire.</p>
            <p>
                The 2013 "Mandarin" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country,
                inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed.
                Stark
                continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark
                defeated
                Killian, and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol after almost losing
                Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more
                armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of Baron Strucker and acquiring
                Loki's
                Scepter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Scarlet Witch's visions, built
                Ultron
                with the help of Bruce Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to
                retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program,
                decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not
                without
                massive civilian cost and many lives being lost during which Sokovia was elevated into the sky.
            </p>
            <p>

                After the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the
                A.I.
                created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually
                convinced
                Stark to support the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally Captain America
                when
                the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The result
                left
                the Avengers in complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier's role in his
                parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a
                better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.
                In 2018, when Thanos and the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six Infinity
                Stones,
                Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on Titan with the help of the Guardians
                of
                the Galaxy. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the Time Stone for Stark's
                life. After the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the
                Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by
                Captain
                Marvel, who brought them back to Earth.
            </p>
            <p>

                In the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a
                daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method to safely travel through time and space, he rejoined the
                Avengers in their mission to acquire the six Infinity Stones from the past in order to resurrect those
                killed by the Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter and regain the Tesseract. During
                the
                Battle of Earth, Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who
                traveled through time to collect their Infinity Stones, saving the universe from decimation and leaving
                behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered superheroes.Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark[9] was a
                billionaire
                industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but

                <ol class="paragraph">
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Perseverance: </strong>Tony doesn’t give up. He built a flying suit of armor using
                            scrapes in a cave, he synthesized a new element when he was on the verge of death, he went
                            head-to-head with a super soldier with nothing but a gauntlet/watch device.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Bravery: </strong>This one goes somewhat with the first. Tony is one of the most base
                            level heroes in MCU and yet he still runs head on into some of the most dangerous situations
                            to
                            help people. I mean, he faced down Loki without his suit.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Self-preservation: </strong>I think this can be learned in a “don’t act like Tony”
                            way. While Tony can be incredibly brave, his bravery often works against him because he
                            takes it to the point of recklessness. He got thrown out of a window by Loki because he
                            pushed Loki too far with his snarky comments.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Be your own person: </strong>Tony was someone who could have easily coasted through
                            life on his father’s fame and money but instead he became greater than his father. Tony is
                            also his own person in public. He acknowledges when he has done something wrong, but he
                            doesn’t allow others to dictate who he should be.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Loyalty: </strong>Tony is always trying to protect the people he cares about. He
                            becomes Iron Man in the memory of Yinsen, he makes sure his closest friends are secure when
                            he is dying, all of these show how loyal Tony can be.</p>
